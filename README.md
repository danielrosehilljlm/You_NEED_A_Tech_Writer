# So You **Need** A Technical Marketing Writer?

I maintain these small Github repositories primarily to contain some personal projects (mostly to do with backups, data protection, and Linux).

However, seeing as I serve mostly technology clients — and they tend to sometimes peruse Github — I thought I'd be a bit creative and plug my writing services here. 

Desperate times and all that*

So, without further introductions:

(*Offbeat humor. Sort of).

## What writing do you do?

I specialize in long-form writing. Typically, writing projects that are more than 1,000 words in length.

Some examples include:

✅ Blogs and articles <br/>
✅ E-books <br/>
✅ White papers <br/>

Less commonly I write:

✅ Speeches <br/>
✅ Books. The kind you hold in your hand. 

And here's what I don't do:

❌ Microcopy (landing pages, email marketing campaigns) <br/>
❌ Social media posts

## Are you a technical writer?

I am a technical **marketing** writer. 

It's kind of my own terminology — although I've seen others use it. And it's usually self-explanatory enough that that's all I have to say. 

But in case it needs elaborating, I:

✅ Help companies (typically technology companies; often selling B2B) to better explain, communicate, position, and market their products or services.

I do not:

❌ Engage in API writing, documentation, and other projects that are better left to those who left cerebral hemisphere is dominant.

## How long have you been doing this?

I've been working for myself full time for about 2 years. I freelanced for about 3 years prior to that on a part-time basis. On top of that, I've worked in-house as several at several companies:

- I managed marketing communications ("MarCom") at a [political technology company](https://www.ecanvasser.com) and an [industrial IoT provider](https://www.ayyeka.com).
- I assisted with the technical account management time at a PR company.

## What can you write about?

Technology is my comfort zone (to the extent that it is comfortable — and understandable!). But naturally I have focused on some niches.

I am very interested in:

- Cloud computing <br/>
- Open source <br/>
- Linux <br/>
- Backups

But I also have written about:

- IoT <br/>
- AR and ML <br/>
- Innovation management <br/>
- Cybersecurity <br/>
- B2C products including antiviruses, VPNs, and ERPs (usually in the guise of writing reviews

## Can I see some writing samples.

You certainly may. 

- I maintain [an online portfolio](https://www.dsrghostwriting.com/portfolio). Because this is all ghostwriting it's password protected. Drop me a line if you would like it.
- There's an archive of my (diminishing) collection of personal writing [here](https://www.danielrosehill.co.il/mywriting/). Please understand that as the vast majority of what I write is ghostwriting for clients (non-bylined), that this isn't necessarily reflective of my recent "work".

<hr>

## Can I see a resume?

Of course. Just [email me](https://dsrghostwriting.com/contact/) and I will send the link.

I haven't yet gotten over my awkwardness about putting my resume out "in the open". 

<hr>

## Do you have references/testimonials?

Ditto. I'll send on a password protected list. I do ghostwriting. Without wishing to sound too much like a character from a spy movie, I try to be as discreet as possible and not splash my clients' logos and images over my website. This isn't all a big giant lie. I promise. 

<hr>

## How much do you charge?

Money can be an awkward and sensitive subject. 

So although the true answer is: "it depends on the spec" in the hope of saving both parties from engaging in unnecessary conversations I provide some ballpark guidance on my website

My rates are, roughly mid-tier. 

If you're looking for a cheap and cheerful writer for your blog posts ($100/1,000 words) I'm afraid that I'm the wrong guy. However, if you can't afford to spend $1,000 for the same projects that's fine too. I'm somewhere in the middle and I typically quote in the $400-800 range for those blog posts depending on complexity.

## How can I get in touch?

Talking usually makes sense.

You can book a time to speak [here](https://dsrghostwriting.com/bookmeeting/).

Daniel.
